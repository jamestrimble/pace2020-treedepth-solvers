# James Trimble's entries to the 2020 PACE Challenge

This repository contains my entries to the exact and heuristic treedepth tracks of [PACE](https://pacechallenge.org/) 2020.
The `exact-solvers` and `heuristic-solvers` directories each contain a README file with more information.

## DOI of v1.0.0, which was submitted to PACE Challenge

## **Newer versions**

The [`jamestrimble/bute` repository](https://github.com/jamestrimble/bute) contains two newer versions of the Bute solver: one written in C, and one in Java.  If you are looking for a fast, reliable solver without a heuristic presolver I recommend using either of the two new versions.  If you wish to compare against a published algorithm I recommend using the Bute-Plus solver in the current repository.

## Solver description papers

Solver descriptions for the exact solver [Bute-Plus](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2020/13337/) (which
came first in the exact track of PACE 2020) and
the heuristic solver [Tweed-Plus](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2020/13338/) (which came fourth
in the heuristic track) have been published in the IPEC 2020 proceedings.
