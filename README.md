# James Trimble's entries to the 2020 PACE Challenge

This repository contains my entries to the exact and heuristic treedepth tracks of [PACE](https://pacechallenge.org/) 2020.
The `exact-solvers` and `heuristic-solvers` directories each contain a README file with more information.

## DOI of v1.0.0, which was submitted to PACE Challenge

## Solver description papers

Solver descriptions for the exact solver [Bute-Plus](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2020/13337/) (which
came first in the exact track of PACE 2020) and
the heuristic solver [Tweed-Plus](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2020/13338/) (which came fourth
in the heuristic track) have been published in the IPEC 2020 proceedings.

## Java version of Bute

I have begun work on a [Java version](https://github.com/jamestrimble/bute) of the Bute solver.
My aim is for this to be much more readable than the C version submitted to the PACE challenge.
